# TaskHive
This is my Project creation where I create a Smart To-Do list Web - application called TaskHive.

# TaskHive - Quick Start

1. Place this project folder in your web server (e.g., XAMPP's htdocs).
2. Import `init_db.sql` into your MySQL server.
3. Put `ca.pem` next to `db.php` (Aiven SSL certificate).
4. Ensure PHP has mysqli & openssl enabled.
5. Visit http://localhost/<folder>/welcome.php
